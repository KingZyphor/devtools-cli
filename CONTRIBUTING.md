Thank you for considering a contribution. This file defines expectations and a smooth workflow.

Process
-------
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feat/your-feature`.
3. Add your change with tests or clear usage documentation.
4. Open a Pull Request against `main`.

Guidelines
----------
- Keep changes focused and incremental.
- Document new commands in `Terminal Commands/README.md` and the top-level README.
- Ensure shell scripts remain POSIX-friendly where possible.
- Make sure every script is executable and supports a `-h` or `--help` mode.
